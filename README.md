# ToxFX

ToxFX is an automated toxicogenomics analysis and reporting tool. It is a 3 tier web application implemented with a Java desktop application user interface, a Java server application, and a MySQL database. It employs DrugMatrix gene expression data, pathway information, and toxicity signatures to formulate detailed reports, and supplementary results files from user-provided gene expression data sets. Each report contains an executive summary, study description, details of the quality control metrics, relative impact on transcription, DM signature scores, relative response of pathways, cytochrome P450 changes, and most consistent gene expression changes. Less than 5 minutes are typically required from upload ofnormalized data to output of a report.
